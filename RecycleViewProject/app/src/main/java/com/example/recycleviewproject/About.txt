To Create Recycle View We have to foolow the below Steps:

1- We have to create a Model Class where we define the fields which 'll use in recycle view. In
our project it is RecipeModel.java

2- in activity_main.xml we define the recycle view layout
3- Now we create another sample layout in which we define the layout that we want inside our
recycleview layout

NOTE: How To Create another Layout
=====
1- Right Click on layout folder inside res
2- Click on New, than Click on Layout Resource File


4- Now create an Adapter Class. This class is used to inflate the sample_recycleview layout
and all findViewById of this sample layout is done here
In our example it is RecipeAdapter.java

5- This findByID task we do inside another class that 'll be the sublcass of RecipeAdapter.java

 public class ViewHolder extends RecyclerView.ViewHolder {
        ImageView imageView;
        TextView textView;

        public ViewHolder(@NonNull View itemView) {
            super(itemView);
            imageView = itemView.findViewById(R.id.imageView);
            textView = itemView.findViewById(R.id.textView);
        }
    }

6- Our Main RecipeAdapter.java extends RecyclerView.Adapter<RecipeAdapters.ViewHolder>
Here inside the <Our Main Class i.e RecipeAdapter. Our Subclass i.e ViewHolder>

after extending this we have to implement 3 method
   onCreateViewHolder => It is used to inflate our sampler layout
   onBindViewHolder => Used to bind the data to this sampler layout
   getItemCount => Used to return size of List of Model Class

7- Now go to MainActivity.java and create the List of the Model Class
      recyclerView = findViewById(R.id.recycleView)
      RecipeAdapters adapters = new RecipeAdapters(list, this);   // We created this class
      recyclerView.setAdapter(adapters);

     Now we have to decide the Layout for this So For Linear Layout add below code in MainActivity
         LinearLayoutManager linearLayout = new LinearLayoutManager(this);
         recyclerView.setLayoutManager(linearLayout);
